    <h1 class="title animated fadeIn">Smart Application</h1>
        <p class="abstract animated fadeIn" >My first product as a Product Design at Capital One Labs was geared toward subprime credit customers. The primary objective was to learn why they come to Capital One for their first credit card, but then leave as soon as they are able to. This was my first real exposure to nascent user research, and the path itself was long and arduous but we ended with a solution that dynamically helps Capital One get the applicant in the right card. It has been in pilot for over a year now (August 17) and has been performing exceptionally well.

    <h3 class="subTitle">1. Research</h3>
    <p class="abstract">We knew there was a reason why customers left us as a company after a pretty uniform amount of time, we just weren’t sure what that was. We set off to learn more about the people that make up the subprime segment and what makes them tick.  </p>

    <h3 class="projectTitle">a. Empathy Interviews</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        My team and I performed 10 empathy interivews to learn how people first get into credit, what goes wrong, and then why they end the relationship by moving to another card. We learned that a lot of people apply for cards based on factors other than what they think they can handle. 
        <br />
        We realized that its up to us as a company to help ensure people get in the right cards the first time. 
    </p>    

        <h3 class="projectTitle">b. Experiment Design</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        One of the fun things about design thinking is when you break out of the box of the existing tools and create your own. We needed a more linear perspective of the decisionmaking process, so we had our interviewees write a "breakup letter" to their old credit card company. We used these letters to map out the journey. 
    </p>        
    
    
    <h3 class="subTitle">2. Synthesis and Ideation</h3>
    <p class="abstract">
        We unpacked and clustered themes we saw accross all of the interviews we did. Uncovering themes is the most entertaining aspect of empathy work. </p>

    
       <h3 class="projectTitle">a. Affinity Clustering</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
         We took quotes that resonated from the Empathy Interviews we did and clustered them to see trends and patterns that we worth exploring more.
    </p>       
        <h3 class="projectTitle">b. Journey Mapping</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        The fellow designer and I mapped out the experience as we heard it from the perspective of many of our interviewees. This was my first time doing journey mapping and its now something I use often. Why this activity was so useful was it uncovered a lot of the things we could've asked for and would've prevented the break up.
    </p>    
    
</div>

 <h3 class="subTitle">3. Concepting </h3>
    <p class="abstract">We wanted to draw a few concepts of ideas that could possibly address what we were learning about how and why people break up with their credit cards. The main trend accross all of our research was that we simply didn't do a great job putting people in the right cards at the right time. This led us to want to build a new application that had an interface that would dig in, and learn more about a consumer when necessary. 
    <br />
    The secondary insight was that people are willing to give more information than we thought when it came to getting the right credit card. Especially if the questions were obviously relevant. We then spent some time codifying them into what would be Questions that the application would ask supplemental to the basic credit underwriting questions.
    </p>
    
      <h3 class="projectTitle">a. Sketching</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
         We first went in with markers and contruction paper to assemble an interaction model that works well. The main design constraint was to allow the user to have control over whether they want to answer more questions. The application should also make it apparent when the user can submit their application.
    </p>        
    
       <h3 class="projectTitle">b. Visual Exploration</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
         After some of the sketching I explored some of the concepts the shook out in various frames. For instance seeing how the form would perform on mobile.

    <p class="abstract">The other designer dropped off the project and it was my time for my personal favorate part of the process, aesthetics. I spent a week polishing our interaction model, wireframing, and creating visual compositions of the entire user flow.</p>

    <p class="abstract">I build out the prototype using vanilla CSS, HTML, and jQuery. It was more custom jquery than I was used to and it pushed me to start coding my own plugins. The new questions that pop up are populated by AJAX. Unfortunately I'm unable to link to the actual form from my portfolio.</p>
