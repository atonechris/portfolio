Smart Application Experience
Demonstration Guide

Introduction:
For the demo you won’t need to type text into any of the fields, you can focus on speaking. The program itself handles the typing. The only interactions necessary for the demonstration are noted explicitly. This is a demo, not a finished product, clicking around will make things look glitchy; and really ruin impressions. Simply follow the step by step instructions listed below; the program does the rest. -

Step-by-Step Instructions by Feature

1.Empathetic Dialogue
		Talking Points:
From the user’s point of view, the information we ask for at application is highly sensitive and deeply personal. Through multiple rounds of testing, We implemented a question / answer of why we need certain information. This comforts applicants and makes them more likely to provide information. The goal of this is to improve overall application completion.“
  	 	Actions:
			Click on “Email” Field
			Click on “First Name” Field
			Click on “Birthdate” Field
			Click on “Social Security Number”

2. Live Bureau / MadMod Integration

Product Steering Experience
		Talking Points:
The application responds immediately to user input and asks only appropriate questions. You can see our different models “thinking” on the bottom of the screen as the user moves from field to field.
The new application has built in product steering that runs existing information as the user is putting it in; and directs the user to the Journey card; which is more suitable for this applicant.
The form knows when all required fields are filled and an “Apply Now” button automatically generates. 
We found a great proxy for subprime graduation is the willingness to answer supplemental questions. By clicking answer additional questions; we can continue to serve the user with more questions.
         		Actions: 
			Type new@capitalone.edu for the email
			Click on “Next”	
				On the Card Steering feature; 
			Click “Apply Now”
				Allow the software to scroll to top of window
			Click on “Do you rent or own your home?”

			Refresh Page

Fairbank Experience
		Talking Point:
With Live Bureau integration we can also serve up market applicants and/or current customers with a, expedited, VIP experience.  When the user inputs their zip it will automatically populate their town and zip.
		Actions: 
			Type rich@capitalone.com for the email
			Click on Zip - Input any US zip code
			Refresh Page




3. Device Awareness

		Talking Point:
The application takes into account the device in which its accessed; and adapts to serve that device to deliver a smooth experience.

		Action: 
			Refresh Page
			Grab corner of browser window; make smaller in width.




4. Landing Page Capabilities

		Talking Point:
By including relevant card information we can onboard directly to the application instead of a landing page. This will improve application completion by affecting the total number of applicants. 

	   	Action: 
			Scroll to top of page and highlight the “Venture Card” image
