    <h1 class="title animated fadeIn">Tank Jet Studios</h1>
        <p class="abstract animated fadeIn" >Coming off a freelancing stint of almost 5 years, I had gotten to a fork where my work was suffering from lack of perspective. There were two other guys in a similar position that I knew from friends of friends. We got together and formed Tank Jet Studios. We did some great work for some large brands, we had a blast, failed, and most importantly learned how to grind, and build a brand.

      <h3 class="subTitle">3. Our Products</h3>
    <p class="abstract">Though client work paid the bills we all longed for solving problems. So after about 6 months of growth we ventured out on our own with three products.</p>
    <h3 class="projectTitle">Domesticated</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        This product was the brainchild of Tank Jet Partner Matt. He's a really talented developer and designer so he created most of the initial concepts. I wasn't involved until we began building the web app and creating awareness. We since took it down but we collected a large database of Made-in-USA products. Relationships were estabished with founders of companies and we learned a lot about what's always been refered to as American Spirit.

<h3 class="projectTitle">Mine Games</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        After Domesticated we decided it would be fun to build a game. We did a bunch of research, which included a lot of game nights. We collaborated on concepting, which was centered around making a game that would appeal to a wide age range. Mine Games is a digital deck-building game (similar to Magic or Dominion) that allows teams up to 3 to play with each other. Jeremy did the illustration, Matt did the back-end, and I did the interface and front-end development.
        <br >
        We built the app using Phonegap, which I've since fell in love with for prototyping.
