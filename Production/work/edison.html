    <h1 class="title animated fadeIn">Edison Properties</h1>

<p>I was commissioned by the Creative Director of Edison Properties to explore new a new visual interface and a user experience overview of their largest web properties. Both of these businesses are iconic New York brands, and it was a joy to work with the creative team that built and maintains them.</p>

        <p class="abstract animated fadeIn" >This was the first project we worked together on. It required heavy exploratory visual design work. The first week was just generating as many “looks” as I could. I tried to explore ways to push the brand’s limits while still leveraging the icon the brand is.

Anyone who lives in or has spent time in New York City know’s that Manhattan Mini Storage is famous for the content on their billboards. Messages are extremely progressive, sometimes completely unrelated to storage, and very tongue in cheek. My goal was to give those messages prominence to those ads on the homepage since they were probably what the user is anchored too.

The primary User Experience initiatives were about solving a couple sales funnel issues. People were getting too little space when they purchased through the website. We realized that most people don’t really recognize the size of a food, especially squared. So they hired a rendering artist to assist in giving scale to the units by putting common items in the renderings.</p></div>

    <p class="abstract">We knew there was a reason why customers left us as a company after a pretty uniform amount of time, we just weren’t sure what that was. We set off to learn more about the people that make up the subprime segment and what makes them tick.</p>
