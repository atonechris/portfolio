    <h1 class="title animated fadeIn">Smart Loan</h1>
        <p class="abstract animated fadeIn" >My first product as a Product Design at Capital One Labs was an alternative for exploitive payday loans with accompanying mechanisms to provide easy access to formal banking instruments so that the likelihood of repeat usages was greatly declined.

    <h3 class="subTitle">1. Research</h3>
    <p class="abstract">We knew there was a reason why customers left us as a company after a pretty uniform amount of time, we just weren’t sure what that was. We set off to learn more about the people that make up the subprime segment and what makes them tick.</p>
</div>
 
<div id="container">
    <div class="quote">
            “"The way these products are structured, it's very difficult to repay the loan, and therefore people end up borrowing again and again and paying far more in fees and interest than they borrowed in the first place.”
            </div>
    
    <h3 class="projectTitle">a. Learning Agenda</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        We needed to create an outline of the things we needed to learn.
    </p>  
    
    <h3 class="projectTitle">b. Experiment Design</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        I designed an experiment using card sorting to dig into how the user makes a decision about who to borrow from.
    </p>    

     <h3 class="projectTitle">c. Empathy Interviews</h3>
    <p class="projectDescription">
       My team and I performed 8 empathy interivews to learn about why people end up using Payday Loans and what causes the need. We learned that the causes range immensely but typically center around things that make getting to work impossible. 
       <br />
       <br />
        Another main learning is that people typically take out another loan to cover the principal of the first, creating a cycle that can reach +1000% APR.

    <h3 class="subTitle">2. Synthesis and Ideation</h3>
        <h3 class="projectTitle">a. Experience Mapping</h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
            Experience Maps are probably one of my favorite tools in my UX toolbox. I use it with every project I take on, and this was no different. Filling out the spaces let me know what are the real pain points and whats important to design for.
        </p>  
        <h3 class="projectTitle">b. Ideation</h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
            We had a team of 2 Product Managers, a Business Analyst, and myself. Ideation can tend to lean towards being single sighted, so its important to bring in other perspectives. We held an “ideation tour” in which we held multiple rounds in different offices with different kinds of employees.
        </p>      
        <h3 class="projectTitle">c. Concepts</h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
            I spent about 2-weeks heads down, creating low fidelity concepts of the top ideas we collected throughout ideation. Hover over the video below to see some of them.
        </p>     
        <h3 class="projectTitle">d. User Feedback</h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
            We then did another round of Empathy Interviews that focused on understanding which concepts resonated with our user base.

     <h3 class="subTitle">3. Interface Design </h3>   
     <p class="abstract">
            After we had the feedback from our user base I felt confident in creating a user experience that could make it easy to apply anywhere (say at a repair shop, on your phone) and quick to get a decision. I built out an experience that was responsive, and touch capable.
     </p>   
     <h3 class="subTitle">3. Front-End Development </h3>   
     <p class="abstract">
            This was my first time digging into Angular.js (Google's Development Framework) and it was such a pleasure. I learned a lot about javascript and the Node Package Manager, as well as developing entire applications while being mindful of size and speed. Unfortunately I'm unable to link to the actual form from my portfolio.
