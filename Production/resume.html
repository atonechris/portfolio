					<p>
						I work in the Labs of Capital One, a leading national financial institution as a Product Designer. My primary responsibilities include user research, presenting research findings to stakeholders, and prototyping concepts before passing them off to production.
						Its been an extremely impactful experience learning the tools for empathizing with the end user, as well as refining presentation and public speaking skills.
					</p>
					<p>
						My time in the labs has led me to: create a loan product, design and code a browser plug-in, own the experience of an in-market servicing app, travel the US doing qualitative research and much more. Its been the most vigorous learning and growth experience
						of my life.
